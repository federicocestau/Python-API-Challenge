# API Challenge 
In this example, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator, grabbing the data from this API:
https://openweathermap.org/api

For the second part I used Google Places API to create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I of the project. See image.

Then I had to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of my coordinates and plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.See image.

API used: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json.
